# Roller Derby Pack Simulator

[Try out the simulator!](https://fish.halfbakers.com/pack_sim/)

The URL to any given pack configuration can be shared/saved and will
re-load the same configuration.

This is intended as a helper to look at scenarios with Pack Definition
in the context of the [WFTDA rules](https://rules.wftda.com/).

Note that it was written way back in 2014 and the rules have likely
changed since then.

If you notice a situation where behaviour here doesn't match the
rules, feel free to create an issue.

Here's a quick run-down:
* Members of the pack (once it's defined) are outlined in white
* Blockers who are in the engagement zone, but NOT members of the pack are outlined in red
* Blockers who are out of play are outlined in gray
* The centre of a given dot represents "the hips" for the purposes of distance measurement
* The outer edges of a dot indicate in/out of bounds. If a blocker is overlapping the edge of the track, they are "straddling", if they are totally out, they are "out" (each looks slightly different)
* The big ugly green lines indicate "Pack is Here"
* The text in the centre of the track summarizes what's going on
