        <p>Here's a quick run-down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Members of the pack (once it's defined) are outlined in white</li>
            <li>Blockers who are in the engagement zone, but NOT members of the pack are outlined in red</li>
            <li>Blockers who are out of play are outlined in gray</li>
            <li>The centre of a given dot represents "the hips" for the purposes of distance measurement</li>
            <li>The outer edges of a dot indicate in/out of bounds. If a blocker is overlapping the edge of the track, they are "straddling", if they are totally out, they are "out" (each looks slightly different)</li>
            <li>The big ugly green lines indicate "Pack is Here"</li>
            <li>The text in the centre of the track summarizes what's going on</li>
        </ul><br/>
